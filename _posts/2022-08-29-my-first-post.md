## This is my first blog post

I think a data scientist gather and analyze large set of data, which can be structured or unstructured. They need to combine the skills of statistics, mathematics and computer science in order to model the data, then interpret the results either for prediction or inference. 

Statistician and data scientist all need to have knowledge of statistical method and computation skills. However, I think statistician focus more on modeling while data scientists focus more on results. The statistician usually targets on building models while data scientist tries to deploy the model to a production system.

I haven’t decided which direction to go for my future career, but I think there are a lot of overlap skills between statistician and data scientist. I think it’s very useful to learn how they work in both area so that I can understand the big picture of the techniques.
