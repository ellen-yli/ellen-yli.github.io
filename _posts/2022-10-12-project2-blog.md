## My project2 blog

This project is a very good experience for me to learn how to contact API by functions to retrieve data. I selected the Food database (spoonacular) for my project. First, I created a function to search recipes by using six of the searching parameters listed in spoonacular API website. Then, I created my own dataset by using this function and did analysis with data summaries including plots. My data analysis is to compare the protein/carbohydrates contents between ketogenic diet and whole30 (most ingredients are allowed) diet. I found some ketogenic recipes have very large number of protein/carbohydrates ratio, which might not be benefic for health as well.
I had a challenge time when developing the function for contacting API. For example, I have a hard time to deal with the arguments with default values. In my function, all default values should be “NULL” since users will control how may parameters they would like to pick. I need to figure out how to put all searching criteria together without the unselected parameters. 
In future I might want to focus more on the request language(gramma) and data structure. It can save more time if knowing the big pictures of the whole process.
