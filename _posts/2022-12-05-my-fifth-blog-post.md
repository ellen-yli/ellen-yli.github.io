## This is my fifth blog post

I think itâ€™s a great course about data science, which makes me gain a deeper understanding of how vast volumes of data been processed and analyzed.  The content I learned from this course will impact how I deal with data in many positive ways. With more structural understanding about data analysis, now I usually follow some standard steps, which makes work more organizes and reproducible. For example, I might spend more time in the preparation step, which includes selecting appropriate goals, defining questions and data cleaning.  I also learned that each analysis method has both advantages and limitations. Not a single method is perfect. In future I might try to apply different approaches to the data set so that we can analyze problems from different angles.

I would like to be a biostatistician in my future. However, nowadays data science can be widely used in all areas. I wish I can use the tools we learned in class and apply them in my work. The one I like most is shiny tool, which is very useful when I would like to create data explore App for my team. Once we have sets of similar data, it becomes an excellent tool to provide a quick and easy way for visualizing data. In future, I might want to learn more about how data analysis applies in daily life cases, such as weather forecast, marketing decision, etc.
