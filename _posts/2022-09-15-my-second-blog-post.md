## This is my second blog post about project 1

The purpose of my [first project](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ellen-yli/ellen-yli.github.io/main/_posts/project-1.html) is to practice the data parsing process as well as writing functions. I learned the skills of using different packages of tidyverse, such as dplyr, readr and ggplot2. I feel knowing how to write a function is such a useful skill that can simply an analysis process especially for multiple datasets.
